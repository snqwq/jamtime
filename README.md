- [ ] customizable timer messages (like "TIMER IS OVER!!!" or whatever the user wants)
- [ ] Project functionality

### v3.0 (future release)
- [ ] Timer categories (game jam, project, etc.)

# Usage

Either [invite the bot to your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1389020970739826799&permissions=17602923513856&integration_type=0&scope=bot) or dm it if you are in a server with it, then you can use the slash commands.

# Installation

*only for if you want to run the bot yourself, otherwise you can just invite it to your server or dm it*

## requirements
- Python 3.12.1 (might work on other versions, but not tested)
- git (only if you want to clone the repo)

1. Clone the repository and cd into it:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snqwq/jamtime.git
    cd jamtime
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token:
    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ```

5. Change any configs in `config.py` as needed (e.g., `IS_DEV = False` if you want to run in production mode or changing `DB_PATH` to a different location)

6. Run the bot:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```
7. If you want to run the bot on startup on Linux, you can set that up using `helpers/setup_linux.sh` (make sure to run it with `chmod +x helpers/setup_linux.sh` first)

8. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
